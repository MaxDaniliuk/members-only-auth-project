# Members Only Authentication Project

A full-stack web application that demonstrates user authentication, access control, and message posting. Logged-in users can post messages, but only authorized users can view post details like post author and date of post creation, creating a "members-only" experience. There is also an admin functionality for deleting posts. However, admin has to be created in advance.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 Secure authentication using **Passport.js** (passport-local strategy)
- 🧾 Role-based access control for members and non-members
- 💬 Logged-in users can create posts
- ⭐ Members can see post details like who created a post and when
- 🧰 Full-stack architecture (React + Express + PostgreSQL)
- 🔄 Persistent sessions and protected routes
<br>

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React v19
- React Router DOM v6
- CSS3

**Backend:**
- Node.js (Express)
- PostgreSQL
- Passport.js for authentication
- bcryptjs for password hashing
<br>

## 🔀 Branches

- main 🌳
  
  Contains the initial project code - the baseline version of the app before Prisma or major refactoring were introduced.

- db-introspection 🗄️

  Prisma was added to the backend in this branch to replace raw SQL queries with Prisma queries. The data models in the Prisma schema were generated by introspecting existing database.

- refactor/codebase-pattern-overhaul ⚡ (work in progress, not pushed yet)

  The branch is dedicated to a major refactor of both backend and frontend which will include:
   - 🧩 Backend:
     - Replacing the MVC-like architecture to Repository–Service–Controller (RSC)
     - Updating middlewares
     - Renaming and reorganizing files
 
   - 🎨 Frontend:
     - Refactoring data fetching logic using TanStack Query instead of some useEffect and useContext hooks in order to handle data updates more efficiently.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MaxDaniliuk/members-only-auth-project.git
cd members-only-auth-project
```

> 💡 **Note:**
> On the main branch, tables "posts" and "users" have to be created manually.

### 2️⃣ Backend setup
1. Go to the `/server` folder:
   
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the `/server` directory:
   
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   DATABASE_URI="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/DATABASE_NAME?connection_limit=5"
   COOKIE_SECRET="SECRET"
   ORIGIN="CLIENT'S localhost"
   PASSCODE="your_passcode"
   ```
4. Run Prisma migrations:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```
5. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Server runs on http://localhost:3000/ (or your configured port).

### 2️⃣ Frontend setup
1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the `/client` folder:

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server in development mode:
   
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Frontend runs on http://localhost:5173/
